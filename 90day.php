    <p class="section-paragraph">The goal of our service is to remove questionable negative information from credit reports. This is not an exact science and there are cases in which we may be unsuccessful. Our clients are protected with our 90 day warranty. If you sign up for service with Sean White & Associates in any program, and do not see any questionable items deleted from your credit in 90 days, you will be entitled to a full refund. This does not mean that your credit will be fixed completely during that period but you should see some of your questionable negative items deleted in this period or your money back. (subject to the terms and conditions set forth below). To apply for a refund please contact your service specialist by phone, so your identity can be verified.</p>
